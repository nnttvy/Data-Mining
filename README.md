"The objective of this project is to explore the operational mechanisms and structure of the ECLAT algorithm, and apply it to the Groceries 2 dataset (provided by the lecturer) for discovering association rules. 

To evaluate the algorithm, measures including Chi-square and LIFT have been employed to assess its effectiveness in mining meaningful association rules applicable in practical scenarios such as product recommendations and business planning. 

In addition to implementing the ECLAT algorithm, the project also incorporates the Apriori algorithm—a widely used association rule mining technique—to provide a comprehensive comparison of the strengths and weaknesses between ECLAT and Apriori."
